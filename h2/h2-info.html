                            powered by a 998cc supercharged inline-four engine, engineered for breathtaking performance.
                            This advanced powerplant delivers exceptional acceleration and top-end power, thanks to its
                            centrifugal supercharger developed in-house by Kawasaki. Precision-tuned for both street and
                            track, the engine balances brute force with refined throttle response, making it one of the
                            most exhilarating machines on two wheels.

                            cast aluminum wheels, the Ninja H2 ensures enhanced handling and reduced unsprung weight.
                            These are paired with high-performance Bridgestone Battlax RS11 tires, specifically chosen
                            to match the H2’s extreme capabilities. The combination provides superior grip, stability,
                            and confidence whether you’re cornering hard or pushing straight-line speed.

                            body design that reflects its performance pedigree. With sharp lines, mirror-finish paint,
                            and a compact, muscular profile, the bike looks as fast as it rides. The craftsmanship and
                            detail in the bodywork not only create visual impact but also support rider ergonomics and
                            heat management.

                        <p style="font-size: 30px; padding-left: 30px;">Aerodynamics play a key role in the Ninja H2's
                            performance. Integrated winglets and a sleek, wind-tunnel-tested design generate downforce
                            at high speeds, improving stability and control. The bodywork channels airflow efficiently,
                            reducing drag while enhancing cooling and overall performance. Every element is designed
                            with speed and stability in mind.
