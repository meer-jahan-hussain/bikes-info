                            Panigale V4 is the 1,103cc Desmosedici Stradale V4 engine, directly derived from Ducati’s
                            MotoGP technology. This high-revving powerhouse delivers raw, race-grade performance with
                            over 210 horsepower, combined with seamless torque delivery and razor-sharp throttle
                            response. The counter-rotating crankshaft and desmodromic valve system offer superior
                            balance and efficiency, making the V4 engine a true centerpiece of Italian engineering
                            excellence.

                            lightweight, five-spoke aluminum wheels designed for strength and agility. These are wrapped
                            in high-performance Pirelli Diablo Supercorsa SP tires, engineered for extreme grip and
                            stability on both street and track. This tire and wheel combination provides superb traction
                            under hard acceleration and excellent feedback through high-speed corners.

                            V4’s bodywork is a blend of aggressive design and aerodynamic function. The bike’s narrow
                            waist, angular fairings, and sharp tail section contribute to a race-bred aesthetic while
                            improving rider movement and control. High-quality materials and Ducati’s signature
                            attention to detail give the body a premium, purposeful finish.

                            profile is engineered for maximum performance. Integrated carbon fiber winglets generate
                            significant downforce, improving stability during braking and high-speed runs. The front
                            fairing and side vents manage airflow to enhance cooling and reduce drag, making the
                            Panigale V4 not just visually striking, but also functionally advanced in aerodynamics.
